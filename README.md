### Learn Phaser: Multi-Scened Games

**Building a Multi-Scened Phaser Game**

Phaser games are defined by Scenes. In a simple game, we might only use one Scene. In more elaborate games, we can use multiple Scenes to build out start screens, end screens, or even different levels.

In this lesson, we’re going to refactor (rewrite the code differently but still achieve the same outcome) an existing game’s code to include multiple Scenes. Along the way, we’ll discuss how to organize our code so that it is easier to maintain and debug.

With these techniques under our belts, we’ll be well on our way to build out multi-Scened games with Phaser!
